# Work Day Scheduler Bootcamp Assignment

This is a simple app for scheduling your day. The user can enter a todo event corresponding to the current or future hour(s) in the work day: 9am-5pm. The user is not allowed to enter a event in the past. When the user clicks the save button, the task is saved in local storage, and will be retrieved on reload.
